=head1 NAME

AuthStorDB::AuthAtt - A model object representing the JOIN between Auths and Tags.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an object that represents a row in the 'user_roles' table of your application
database.  It uses DBIx::Class (aka, DBIC) to do ORM.

You probably won't need to use this class directly -- it will be automatically
used by DBIC where joins are needed.

For Catalyst, this is designed to be used through MyApp::Model::MyAppDB.
Offline utilities may wish to use this class directly.
